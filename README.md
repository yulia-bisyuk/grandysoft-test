Create a simple page with one <canvas> element and a button 'collapse lines';

Function needed: Allow adding lines by two clicks (first click creates the first
position; then user moves the mouse and the line should be visible; if the user
clicks left mouse button again the line should be added to image; if user starts
drawing and presses right mouse button, don’t the line. If a line intersects,
show red dot (independent of line status - creating or added) When the user
clicks “collapse lines”, the lines should be collapsed to the center of the line
as a 3 second animation.

Use: OOP (important) TypeScipt (preferred) or ES6 React (not too important)
